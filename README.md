# wallhavenInstagramBot

Alright this is basically a bot which scrapes images from wallhaven and posts on instagram uwu


## How it works

It uses the wallhaven api, so i just basically send a GET request, download the image as a temp file, upload it on instagrm and boom, idk what was so boom about it
tho ðŸ’€

## How do I use it

  just `npm install` for node packages and `pip install instabot`
  run the code through the batch script provided, paste in the wallhaven id like y8622k, 282p96 etc uwu
  
 
 ## Remarks
   there have been some issues with instabot like send limits, don't use it for bad fkcing morons, remember to change your username and password in both index.js and 
   upload.py
   
   Use the BATCH file, it automates shit
